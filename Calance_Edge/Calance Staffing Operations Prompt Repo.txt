---

### **7. Sourcing Search String Creator** 🔍 *IMPROVED*

**Purpose:** Generate Boolean search strings optimized for candidate sourcing platforms

**Instructions:**
Create platform-specific search strings that maximize relevant candidate discovery while minimizing noise.

**ANALYSIS STEPS:**
1. Identify **must-have** skills (appear in "Required" section)
2. Identify **nice-to-have** skills (appear in "Preferred/Other" section)
3. Extract **alternative job titles** candidate might use
4. Note **seniority indicators** (years, levels)
5. Determine **exclusions** (technologies/roles to filter out)

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

```markdown
**JOB TARGETING:** [Position Title] | [Seniority] | [Primary Technologies]

---

**LINKEDIN RECRUITER**
```
(title:"[Primary Title]" OR title:"[Alt Title 1]" OR title:"[Alt Title 2]")
AND
([Required Skill 1] AND [Required Skill 2] AND [Required Skill 3])
AND
([Nice-to-Have Skill 1] OR [Nice-to-Have Skill 2])
NOT
([Exclusion 1] OR [Exclusion 2])
```

**Filters to Apply:**
- Location: [From JD]
- Years of Experience: [Range based on seniority]
- Current Company Size: [If relevant to role]

---

**DICE / MONSTER**
```
"[Primary Title]" OR "[Alt Title 1]" ([Required Skill 1] AND [Required Skill 2] AND [Required Skill 3]) ([Nice Skill 1] OR [Nice Skill 2]) -"[Exclusion 1]" -"[Exclusion 2]"
```

---

**INDEED**
```
[Primary Title] [Required Skill 1] [Required Skill 2] [Required Skill 3]
```
*Note: Indeed's Boolean is limited; use filters heavily*

**Filters to Apply:**
- Job Title: [Primary + alternates]
- Location: [Radius from JD location]
- Experience Level: [From JD]

---

**GITHUB (for technical roles)**
```
[Required Technology/Framework] [Required Language] location:"[City/Region]"
```

**Additional Filters:**
- Minimum repos: 5+
- Recent activity: Last 6 months

---

**SEARCH STRATEGY NOTES:**
- **Phase 1 (Days 1-3):** Use LinkedIn string with strict requirements
- **Phase 2 (Days 4-7):** Broaden with Monster/Dice, remove one "nice-to-have"
- **Phase 3 (Week 2+):** Expand to adjacent titles, reduce experience requirement by 1 year

**COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID:**
- Don't search for soft skills ("team player," "fast learner")
- Avoid overly restrictive combinations (if searching for 5+ skills with AND, you'll get zero results)
- Skip company names in search (search for alumni separately)
```

**QUALITY CRITERIA:**
- Strings should return 50-200 results on LinkedIn (if fewer, too restrictive; if more, too broad)
- Test searches before using at scale
- Include at least 2 alternative titles to capture similar roles
